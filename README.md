# User Experience
## Goals
### Visitor Goals
Initially the site will be used by a bicycle mechanic who wants to save customer service history, at the same time as setting a reminder to book in a future service. The mechanic will want to be able to: 
- Find work carried out in the past
- See when the next service is due.

### Business Goals
The Business Goals for the site will be:
-  to provide a reliable service history for customers as well as aiding in scheduling services for the mechanic.
    The customer will hopefully feel reassured knowing that the work being carried out is well documented. As a result trending issues can be spotted and dealt with accordingly.
- to enable the mechanic to be able to better maintain repeat custom.
- to build a better relationship with the customer and help to better ensure their safety. Safety in the sense that a well maintained bicycle will be safer on the roads.


### User Stories
- The mechanic would like to know when a part was fitted to know if it was still under warranty.
- The mechanic would like to be able to check to see if a bike was stolen and report it to the police.
- The mechanic wants to be able to update the ownership details of a bicycle.

## Visual Design

### Fonts
I used the basic fonts supplied with Google's Materialize.
These are easy to read, and given that the content is almost entirely text, I felt that was a priority.

### Icons
I used fontawesome's icons to make the buttons and and text more intuative and attractive.

### Colors
I went with red and white like the classic doctors symbology. My initial plan was to build a clinic for bicycle type page, but time constraints meant it wasn't possible.
